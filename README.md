# Pet Adoption

Lavras, Brazil it's a city with a big problem of abandoned animals. Be it dogs or cats, you see them all the time abandoned on the streets.
With that in mind, me and a good friend decided to create a website where people can post a pet for adoption and hopefully someone will adopt it.
The application went on air in 2015 and got over 100 adoptions and got featured in a couple of local news media.

* Java 11
* Spring Boot
* Groovy
* Hibernate
* PostgreSQL

* Angular Material
